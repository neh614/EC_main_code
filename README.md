# Endometrial Cancer Detection System

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on the detection and analysis of **Endometrial Cancer**
using image preprocessing and deep learning techniques.
A **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** is used to classify medical images,
and a simple web interface is provided for interaction.

The project is implemented in **Python** using **TensorFlow/Keras** and **Flask**.

## 🧠 Model Information
The trained deep learning model file (`.h5`) is **not included** in this repository
due to GitHub file size limitations.

To run this project:
- Train the model locally  
  **OR**
- Place the trained model file in the project root directory with the name:

pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
